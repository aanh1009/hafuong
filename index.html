                  <p>
                    <p class="t">Character, possibilities : </p> These people are idealistic. They have an idealistic approach towards themselves and towards their surroundings. They will go on a journey that will help them gain experience and meet important people. They have a high level of mental energy and they are be able to handle all the difficulties and challenges. It is good if they become more devoted to their goals and become more sensitive and courageous. They are responsible. Sometimes they do not realise the depth of their wisdom. They have no need for high material security. Love, the truth and friendships are very important. They have a strong need to give much of themselves to others. At mature age they will sometimes experience unexpected success and the realisation of big plans. Broad communication with the public or with people abroad; they learn easily.</p>
                  <p class="x">
                    Weaknesses, what should be learned:
Beware of the tendency to have delusions, be extremely emotional, and have moody and exaggerated reactions. Beware of tendency to emotional stress and mental excesses.

                    <p class="t">Sun in Gemini <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-blizenci.gif"/></p>People born under the sign of Gemini are people of many talents and they are able to use their skills in both theory and practice. They are very intelligent and quick-witted people who are interested in everything that happen around them, and they can quickly adapt to any new situation. They are open to all novel things in the world, because they can quickly see their advantages. They try to show these novel things to others so that they can also benefit from them. But more conservative people often do not have an understanding for this. They are sociable people that have representative personalities and they can inspire and influence others with their innate charm and vigour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <p class="z">Sun in the 2nd house</p>The Sun in the second house focuses on resources of the person. These people have the energy to achieve their personal goals, financial security and other material values. Their desire to achieve material success is just as strong as their desire for financial independence. The Sun creates not only the desire but also the abilities needed to achieve material success. These people often use most of their energy on making money simply for the purpose of spending it and enjoying material things.

You may underestimate what you want from yourself and for yourself. Shyness may be accompanied by resentment of the fact that others ignore you.

                  <p>
                    <p class="z">Moon in the 9th house</p>The Moon in the ninth house creates an understanding and imaginative mind. These people are great dreamers and thinkers who have novel ideas. Their views are solid and sincere, but they change their minds easily. They have a variety of interests and hobbies; they like to lecture other people. The Moon gives these people inner self-determination, which gives them the energy to lead and direct those who lack the same degree of awareness.

This position stimulates the mind and forms humorous people who are able to express themselves skilfully. They are deep thinkers, but they are also bright, adaptable and versatile.

They dislike superficial happiness and their precious feelings are hidden in their dark side. They are willing to go through difficult situations to access these feelings and may find opportunities for sexual experiences during their search for depth and catharsis.

                    <p class="z">Jupiter in the 7th House</p>
                      Jupiter in the seventh house suggests that this planet will bring happiness in marriage or partnership. These people are friendly, charitable and fair. Their success will be at least partly the result of their good judgment in choosing a good partner and developing a successful relationship. Other negative aspects of the horoscope may affect this area and cause too much optimism about personal relationships and marriage.</p>
